## OuwN Website
# Introsuction
OUWN is a web-based platform that helps healthcare professionals convert clinical notes into ICD codes quickly and accurately. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), OUWN reduces coding errors, saves time, and improves efficiency in healthcare documentation. The goal of OUWN is to make medical coding faster, simpler, and more reliable, supporting better patient care and streamlined billing processes.

The OUWN platform is developed using a combination of web and machine learning technologies. The frontend of the system is built with standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals. The backend of the website can be implemented using web programming languages such as PHP or Node.js, which handle user requests, data management, and communication with the machine learning module. The machine learning component, responsible for processing clinical notes and predicting ICD codes, is developed in Python using libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, spaCy, and NLTK. A relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL is used to securely store clinical notes, ICD codes, and user data. Together, these technologies create an efficient and reliable system that integrates web development with artificial intelligence to support automated medical coding.
